## Instructions

Use a Haiku subagent to fetch and display location data:

```bash
# Locate the script (optimized search)
LOCATIONS=(
  "$HOME/.config/opencode/command/physical/scripts/location-query.ts"
  "./.opencode/command/physical/scripts/location-query.ts"
  "$HOME/.claude/skills/physical/scripts/location-query.ts"
  "./skills/physical/scripts/location-query.ts"
)

SCRIPT=""
for loc in "${LOCATIONS[@]}"; do
  if [ -f "$loc" ]; then
    SCRIPT="$loc"
    break
  fi
done

if [ -z "$SCRIPT" ]; then
  # Fallback to slow search only if explicit paths fail
  SCRIPT=$(find ~ -name location-query.ts -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | head -1)
fi

if [ -z "$SCRIPT" ]; then
  echo "Error: location-query.ts not found. Check install."
else
  bun "$SCRIPT" all
fi
```

Parse and display:
