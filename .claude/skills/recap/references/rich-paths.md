# RICH MODE — 18-Path Detection

Full detection for edge cases. Use when:
- Something feels wrong
- Need detailed diagnosis
- Session is confused

## Data Gathering

```bash
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Git state
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
MODIFIED=$(git status --short 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
CONFLICTS=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

# Focus file
FOCUS_FILE="$ROOT/psi/inbox/focus-agent-main.md"
if [ -f "$FOCUS_FILE" ]; then
  FOCUS_STATE=$(head -1 "$FOCUS_FILE" | sed 's/STATE: //')
  FOCUS_MTIME=$(stat -f%m "$FOCUS_FILE" 2>/dev/null)
  NOW=$(date +%s)
  FOCUS_HOURS=$(( (NOW - FOCUS_MTIME) / 3600 ))
  grep -q "^STATE:" "$FOCUS_FILE" || FOCUS_STATE="corrupted"
else
  FOCUS_STATE="missing"
fi

# Activity log
ACTIVITY_LOG="$ROOT/psi/memory/logs/activity.log"
[ -f "$ACTIVITY_LOG" ] && LAST_ACTIVITY=$(tail -1 "$ACTIVITY_LOG" | cut -d'|' -f3 | xargs)

# Latest retro
LATEST_RETRO=$(find "$ROOT/psi/memory/retrospectives" -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v CLAUDE | sort -r | head -1)
```

## Detection Precedence (In Order)

**Priority matters. Check conditions in this exact order, stop at first match.**

| Order | Condition | Return Path | Why |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | Git in merge/rebase state | GIT_CONFLICT_STATE | Prevents accidental commands |
| 2 | CONFLICTS > 0 | BLOCKER | Technical blocker—must resolve |
| 3 | FOCUS_STATE == "corrupted" | CORRUPTED_FOCUS | Can't parse, must fix |
| 4 | FOCUS_STATE == "pending" + has reason | BLOCKER | User explicitly waiting |
| 5 | FOCUS_STATE == "pending" + no reason | PENDING_NO_REASON | Incomplete state—clarify |
| 6 | FOCUS focusing + age < 4h | DEEP_WORK | Continue uninterrupted |
| 7 | FOCUS hours > 24 + recent commits | ASYNC_WORK | Work continued off-book |
| 8 | Both focus files exist | MULTI_FOCUS | Pattern collision—consolidate |
| 9 | Branch 100+ commits ahead | BRANCH_DIVERGED | Strategy needed before sync |
| 10 | "completed" in activity + files modified | INCOMPLETE_AFTER_MARKED_DONE | State inconsistency |
| 11 | MODIFIED > 5 + not focusing | UNCLEAN | Need attention |
| 12 | FOCUS_STATE == "completed" | TRANSITION | Clear finish line |
| 13 | FOCUS age >= 4h | STALE_FOCUS | Verify still current |
| 14 | No focus + clean git + gap | FRESH_START | Complete blank slate |
| 15 | No activity.log | NO_ACTIVITY_LOG | First session or reset |
| 16 | Tracks untouched 7+ days | TRACKS_DORMANT | Momentum loss |
| 17 | Retro corrupted (missing sections) | CORRUPTED_RETRO | Data integrity issue |
| 18 | (else) | CONFUSED | Doesn't fit patterns |

## Output Paths

### Path: BLOCKER (Conflicts or Pending)

```markdown
# RECAP — BLOCKED

[TIME]

**Blocker**: [reason from focus or conflict list]

---

What's needed to unblock?
```

**When**: Conflicts exist OR `STATE: pending` with reason

---

### Path: GIT_CONFLICT_STATE

```markdown
# RECAP — 🚩 Git In Merge/Rebase

[TIME]

Git is active in merge/rebase. All commands will fail.

**Steps**:
1. Resolve: `git status`
2. Continue: `git merge --continue` or `git rebase --continue`
3. Or abort: `git merge --abort` or `git rebase --abort`

Ready?
```

# RECAP — Async Work Detected

[TIME]

Focus last updated: [FOCUS_HOURS] hours ago

But commits found: [last 2 commits]
